# Chennai Astronomy Club

The Chennai Astronomy Club was started in November 2013 by a group of like minded individuals committed to the cause of promoting astronomy in Chennai. Our activities include star parties where astronomers head to dark locations outside the city limits to observe the skies with their equipment. We also conduct regular meetings, hangouts and outreach programs for schools, organisations and the less priviledged.
