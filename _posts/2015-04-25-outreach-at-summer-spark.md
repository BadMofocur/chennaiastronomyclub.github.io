We conducted an outreach program for about 80 kids and 10 caretakers at the Summer Spark camp conducted by Aim For Seva.

We gave a talk on astronomy and clarified the doubts that the kids had regarding astronomy and science in general. The kids were really enthusiastic and asked some wonderful questions.

The observation session was marred by cloudy weather and we could only show the moon to the kids. Later, we managed to show Jupiter Â to some of them.
