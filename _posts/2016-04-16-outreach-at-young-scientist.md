We conducted an outreach program for about 30 kids at [Young-Scientist](http://young-scientist.in/), Siruseri.

We started off with a discussion session on the Sun and seasons and the kids asked some wonderful questions. It was fun interacting with them.

We then had a telescope session where we observed the moon and Jupiter.
