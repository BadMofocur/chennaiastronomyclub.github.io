We conducted an outreach program for about 30 kids in Kilpauk for kids of members from the Ladies Circle of India.

Manick, Adhvaidh and Siva started off with a small talk on a few astronomy trivia and then proceeded with an observation session. We had two telescopes - a 5 inch reflector and a 6 inch SCT to show the sky to the participants.

The kids and their parents enjoyed seeing the moon and the Orion Nebula.
