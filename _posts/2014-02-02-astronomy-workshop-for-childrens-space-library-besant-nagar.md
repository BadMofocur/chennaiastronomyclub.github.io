Mr. Manick Rajendran conducted a workshop for some kids at Children's Space Library, Besant Nagar.

The kids asked various interesting questions and it was a pleasure to interact with them.

Some interesting questions where:
Why are planets round and asteroids aren't?
Why is there no eclipse on every full moon day?
