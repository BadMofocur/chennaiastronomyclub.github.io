Clouds ruined the night.

We managed to observe using the two narrow gaps between 10:20 and 10:50 PM and 3:10 to 3:30 PM.

Here is a list of objects that we observed in that approximately 1 hour viewing window:

* M45, M1 in Taurus. 
* M79 in Lepus. 
* M42, M43, M78 in Orion. 
* M36, M37, M38 in Auriga. 
* M35 in Gemini. 
* M41 in CMa. 
* M50 in Monoceros. 
* M46, M47, M93 in Puppis. 
* M48 in Hydra. 
* M44 in Cancer. 
* M84, M86, M49, M60, M59, M58, M87, M89, M90, M61 in Virgo. 
* M104 in Corvus. 
* M13 in Hercules. 
* M12, M10, M107 in Ophiuchus. 
* M80, M4, M6, M7 in Scorpius. 
* M57 in Lyra. 
* M8, M20, M21 in Sagittarius.

We also spotted Omega Centauri, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars.

A total of 40 Messier objects in around 50 minutes. This was more of a Messier sprint than a Messier marathon grin emoticon
We are going to have the Messier marathon again after a fortnight and I hope clouds don't ruin it for us then.
