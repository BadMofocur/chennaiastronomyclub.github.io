14 members of the Chennai Astronomy Club set out to Yelagiri for this star party.

We had quite a lot of equipments this time - two 8 inch dobs, three 5 inch scopes and a couple of binoculars.

We started off with the usual objects in Ursa Major, Leo, Orion, Taurus, Virgo, Gemini and Cancer before getting
clouded out. We spotted the Eskimo nebula this time and it was the first time many people in the group saw this.
