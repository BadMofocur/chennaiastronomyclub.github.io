We celebrated the International Sun Day organised by the Charlie Bates Solar Astronomy Project with some wonderful kids at Kolathur, Chennai. We observed the sun with filters and then had a session on astronomy. The kids asked a few amazing questions and we taught them some basic astronomy. We then had a stargazing session in the night.
