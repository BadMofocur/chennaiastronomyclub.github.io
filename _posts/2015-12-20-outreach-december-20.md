The Chennai Astronomy Club conducted an outreach program at DABC Mithilam today. 

What started out as a small crowd soon grew close to 100 when the telescopes were brought out. The early attenders had the chance to learn about the sun as well and we gave them solar goggles courtesy the Charlie Bates Solar Astronomy Project.

The session was conducted by Manick Rajendran from the Amateur Astronomers Association of Princeton.
