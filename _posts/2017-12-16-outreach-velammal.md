We conducted an outreach program for 57 kids at Velammal International School, Ponneri.

We started off with a discussion session on seasons, reading star charts and using Stellarium.

We then proceeded to teach them about the sun following which we had a solar observation. Free solar glasses were given away courtesy of the Charlie Bates Solar Astronomy Project.
