We had our monthly meeting today which was attended by 17 people. We spoke about how to get started with visual astronomy.

The participants were given a brief introduction on reading star charts and were given a set of tasks to complete after
they were grouped in teams. They quickly learnt some stuff and seemed eager to join the future meetups as well.
