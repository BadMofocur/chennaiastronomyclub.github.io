13 members of the Chennai Astronomy Club set out to Nagalapuram for the winter star party.

We had a wonderful experience 3 telescopes(8 inch, 5 inch and a 4 inch), several binoculars and three astrophotographers.

2. M81, M82
3. M106
4. The Leo triplet
5. M95
6. M96
7. M105
8. C96
9. The Sombrero galaxy
10. The Orion Nebula - looked like a photograph from the 8 inch scope in Nagala.

We missed a few objects like the Whirlpool, Pinwheel and Comet Catalina due to the low hanging clouds in north and east.
